"""
This module defines the network architecture based on the MLPF block used to produce potent and probabilistic forecasts.

Classes:
    MLPForecastNetwork: Base class for multilayer perceptron (MLP) forecast networks.
    LaplaceForecastNetwork: MLP forecast network for time series forecasting using the Laplace distribution.
    MLPMCDGaussForecastNetwork: MLP forecast network for time series forecasting using the Modified Cholesky Decomposition Multivariate Normal (MCDGauss) distribution.
    FPQRNetwork: Full Parameterised Quantile Regression Network.
    QRNetwork: Quantile Regression Network.
